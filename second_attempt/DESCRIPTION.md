WeÂ´re building a Vet application, and we want to add a new feature.

A vet should be able to create a reminder for a pet. 
To create a reminder we need:
* the vet's email
* the time to add to the current date (it could be number of days or months)
* the week day when it should take place
* the name of the pet
* the birthday of the pet
* the email of the owner
* type of reminder: treat for parasites, follow-up, check-up, screening
* a message
The reminder should be visible for both the owner and the vet.
Also, take into account that the vet will see the reminders ordered depending on the type
and the age of the pet.
The result reminder date should be a date in the future, that is correct and should correspond with the week day indicated.

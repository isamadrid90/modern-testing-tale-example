Hello, are you able to give me some request and responses for an API that I'm designing? The details are specified in my file DESCRIPTION.md

great, thank you. Now I'll need help with a test. I need a unit test for a rest api controller to ensure the vetEmail inside the request is correctly on the response
--- This doesn't generate the desired output, the tests generated has @WebMvcTest which will create the collaborators required by the controller
but I just need the unit test
I just want a unit test that with an object containing the vetEmail, calls a function and checks the response
but I prefer to create the controller not inject it
ok now it's better but I want the code in Kotlin 2.0
